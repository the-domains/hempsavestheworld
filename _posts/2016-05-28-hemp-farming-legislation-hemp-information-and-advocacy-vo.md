description: "Vote Hemp, the nation's leading hemp grassroots advocacy organization working to bring back hemp farming in the US, is excited to report that on February 7, 2014, President Obama signed the Agriculture Act of 2014, the Farm Bill, into law. Section 7606 of the act, Legitimacy of Industrial Hemp Research, defines industrial hemp as distinct and authorizes institutions of higher education or state departments of agriculture in states where hemp is legal to grow hemp for research or agricultural pilot programs. Since hemp has not been grown in the United States since 1957, there is a strong need for research to develop new varieties of hemp that grow well in various states and meet the current market demands."

Vote Hemp, the nation's leading hemp grassroots advocacy organization working to bring back hemp farming in the US, is excited to report that on February 7, 2014, President Obama signed the Agriculture Act of 2014, the Farm Bill, into law. Section 7606 of the act, Legitimacy of Industrial Hemp Research, defines industrial hemp as distinct and authorizes institutions of higher education or state departments of agriculture in states where hemp is legal to grow hemp for research or agricultural pilot programs. Since hemp has not been grown in the United States since 1957, there is a strong need for research to develop new varieties of hemp that grow well in various states and meet the current market demands.
