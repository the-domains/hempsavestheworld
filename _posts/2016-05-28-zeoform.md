Zeoform is a revolutionary material that changes everything.

Made from cellulose fibres and water -- and absolutely nothing else, our patented process converts cellulose fibres into an industrial strength moulding material capable of being formed into an unlimited array of products.

Zeoform is 100% non-toxic, biodegradable, compostable and 'locks up' carbon into beautiful, functional forms.

A perfect solution for emerging hemp industries and bio-waste nations!
