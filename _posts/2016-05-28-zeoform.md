Zeoform is a revolutionary material that changes everything.

Made from cellulose fibres and water -- and absolutely nothing else, our patented process converts cellulose fibres into an industrial strength moulding material capable of being formed into an unlimited array of products.

Zeoform is 100% non-toxic, biodegradable, compostable and 'locks up' carbon into beautiful, functional forms.

A perfect solution for emerging hemp industries and bio-waste nations!

## Zeoform at a Glance

• **An Australian-based company launching a new global industry**.   
• An **industrial strength** moulding material made of cellulose fibres and water.   
• Made from cellulose by-products including hemp, agricultural bio-mass, recycled or discarded (de-inked) paper, cotton, rice, jute, cane, wood, bamboo and any other clean cellulose feedstock.   
• Produces commercial / industrial grade material **ranging from styrofoam-light to ebony-dense**.   
• Can be combined with dyes, minerals, substrates, sand, cement, carbon, kevlar and other elements to enhance colour, strength, flex, resilience, conductivity, waterproofing and other qualities.   
• An exciting new material for architects, engineers, designers, builders, manufacturers & makers.   
• Offers a sustainable solution for farmers, growers, waste managers, paper mills etc.   
• Will revive declining industries (eg paper mills), offer mass employment, generate new economies.   
• **Help make the world a better place!**

**ZEOFORM** can be sprayed, poured, moulded, pressed or shaped into flat, curved, cylindrical or spherical forms. Forms are then dried, worked, finished and coated to create beautiful and functional products and objects of all kinds.

**ZEOFORM** can be coloured, stained, blended with substrates (organic, metallic, pigment, conductive).

**Surface and texture**

Flat, smooth, embossed, textured, marbled, mottled and or translucent. Surface & texture can be formed to create unique aesthetics and can also be formed to provide additional specific functional properties.

**Finish**

The use of different moulding techniques -- manual, compression, spray and sheet -- all result in the material being formed into a dense, durable, resilient shape that may now need finishing. This material is extremely versatile once it has been formed and has dried solid. A very diverse range of standard tools can now be used to 'play' with ZEOFORM. Exciting and cost effective finishes can be created using -- lathes, mills, routers, thickeners, tumblers, sand blasters, lasers and more.

**Colour**

Using natural pigments, plant based dyes and mineral colours, an incredible range of natural, surface treated or through-body; both neutral and vibrant tones are possible. (check/use from booklet)

**Natural coatings**

Beeswax or carnauba wax, linseed oil, shellac or colofonium offer natural, time proven finishes that are both beautiful and resilient. These materials provide lowest environmental impact (and potentially greatest consumer appeal), being suitable for a wide variety of interior / non-weather conditions.

**Synthetic coatings**

For more intense conditions of moisture, temperature and wearability, the material can be coated with traditional oil-based and acrylic varnishes, polyurethanes, resins and other waterproofing products. The binding properties of the material are comparable to a dense wood (eg ebony), and thus will interact in a similar manner with both colour and waterproofing compounds.

**Intelligent Surfaces**

An industrial revolution in surface treatments & colours now provides for unimaginable qualities -- including colours without pigments, programmable surfaces, UV protection, heat dissipation, water absorbing or water repelling etc.
